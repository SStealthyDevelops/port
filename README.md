# Xyfel A.K.A SStealthy 

Hey! I am Satvik Mathur, a 15 year old Java developer with over 5 years of experience in Java/Spigot. I am advanced in modularized designs and am comfortable with many sophistications in Spigot/BungeeCord:

- MongoDB / MySQL
- Packets (ProtocolLib)
- GUI inferfaces (inventory GUIs)
- WorldEdit API
- Minigames
- BungeeCord Network Management
- Spigot Server Management

I previously worked for BGHDDevelopment as a Lead Developer and multiple servers as a developer/lead developer. All the work here, I developed for my own network (I shut it down because I had other priorities).
